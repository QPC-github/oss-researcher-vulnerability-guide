# Guide to coordinated vulnerability disclosure for security researchers engaging with open source software projects


This repository is a set of resources and reference materials to help security researchers engage with open source projects and perform coordinated vulnerability disclosure (CVD).

## Getting Started

If you are new to coordinated vulnerability disclosure, it is recommended you start with the [Guide](https://github.com/ossf/oss-vulnerability-guide/blob/main/guide.md). While it is dense, you will want to be familiar with this information and the concepts presented *before* you need to address a vulnerability report. 

If you are familiar with coordinated vulnerability disclosure, you can get a refresher by skipping to the [Response Process](https://github.com/ossf/oss-vulnerability-guide/blob/main/guide.md#response-process) section of the Guide, or go straight to the [Runbook](https://github.com/ossf/oss-vulnerability-guide/blob/main/runbook.md).
